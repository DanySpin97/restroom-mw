Scenario sawroom: ReaRetrieved from endpoint
Given that I have a sawroom endpoint named 'endpoint'
And I have a 'string' named 'tag'
And I have a 'string' named 'result'
And I read the data with tag 'tag' from sawroom and save the output into 'result'
When I create the array of '5' random objects of '256' bits
Then print all data
