# Why Restroom

## In a nutshell

Restroom is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) between [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) + [Zenroom](https://zenroom.org)

Restroom exposes dynamic REST endpoints from a directory of Zencode contracts.

Restroom enables to

- create **web services** by just copying a zencode file into a directory
- **augment zencode** with custom actions and operations
- create your **own DSL with zenroom** as a companion for crypto operations
- expose **crypto** hardened operations understandable to stackholders (**in plain English!**)

## Who uses Restroom

Restroom is meant to facilitate the developer experience in terms of convenience and speed.

Mainly used by

- People that want to protoype with zencode smart contract
- People that want to augment the Zencode DSL with new actions and sentences
- People that want to easily create web services from zenroom contracts

- [DECODE](https://decodeproject.eu)

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Features

Restroom comes fully baked, batteries included. Here is a list of things it can do that no other smart contract prototyping platform can:

- Vanilla js, based on common techs (no new languages to learn)
- Smart contracts in plain English (understandable by non developers)
- Instant reload (Fast developer experience)
- Easy setup environment (Run with one command)

## Our misson at Dyne.org

Restroom is crafted with care by developers of the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu) about data-ownership and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). Our effort is that of improving people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create along [privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.

Our mission is to build a thriving, easy accessible ecosystem that enhances privacy and
makes prototyping zencode an enjoyable experience, and generates developer happiness.

We want to help developers build a new generation of modern applications faster, better,
and without the stress and anxiety associated with managing crypto/privacy complexity.
